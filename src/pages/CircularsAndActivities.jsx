        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          At Montfort High School, Repalle, we ensure parents, students, and staff are constantly informed through timely and clear circulars. These circulars serve as an official medium of communication between the school and its stakeholders. Be it important announcements regarding holidays, exams, fee schedules, special assemblies, or parent-teacher meetings ‚Äî all vital information is shared in the form of well-drafted circulars.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Our circulars are posted both on the school notice boards and digitally via our website and messaging platforms. This ensures transparency and bridges communication gaps, keeping everyone updated in real-time. From academic schedules to medical camps, field trips, uniform changes, or new policies ‚Äî every update is communicated with clarity and purpose.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          We believe that keeping parents in the loop fosters trust and involvement in their child‚Äôs educational journey. This section of the website will house the latest as well as archived circulars for easy access by students and parents.
